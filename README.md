# meteorSampleApp
Created from the steps in the Meteor documentation

The project is seperated into two branches, *Master*, which is the result of following the tutorial Meteor provided and : 
### sampleProjectRemix
The sampleProjectRemix branch expands on the initial process of entering a string into a Collection and instead works with a more robust object.

To run the project : 
1) Pull the repo, navigate to either the  *master* or *sampleProjectRemix* branch
2) Open a terminal in directory
3) Type 'meteor'
4) Open up localhost:3000 in your browser
